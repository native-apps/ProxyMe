## Migration Guides

### Migrating from v2.0.0 to v2.1.0

1. **Backup your templates** (optional):
   ```bash
   cp -r ~/.proxyme/templates/user/ ~/proxyme-templates-backup/
   ```

2. **Install new version** using Rider's plugin manager

3. **Restart Rider completely**

4. **Open ProxyMe settings** and verify your models are still there

5. **Click Save** to generate the new `models.json` file

6. **Restart the proxy** to load the new configuration

7. **Test in Rider AI Assistant** - only enabled models should appear

### Migrating from v1.x to v2.x
