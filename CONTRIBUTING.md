## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

**Java Code:**
- Follow standard Java conventions
- Use 4-space indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Add JavaDoc comments for public classes and methods
- Use meaningful variable names

**Example:**
```java
/**
 * Manages the lifecycle of the proxy server.
 * Handles starting, stopping, and restarting the Node.js proxy process.
 */
public class ProxyMeProjectService {
    private Process proxyProcess;
    
    /**
     * Launches the proxy server with the current configuration.
     * 
     * @throws IOException if the proxy process fails to start
     */
    public void launchProxy() throws IOException {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

**JavaScript/Node.js Code:**
- Use 2-space indentation
- Use ES6+ features
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Use `const` and `let`, avoid `var`

**Example:**
```javascript
/**
 * Handles chat completion requests for AI models.
 * @param {Object} req - Express request object
 * @param {Object} res - Express response object
 */
async function handleChatCompletion(req, res) {
  // Implementation
}
```
