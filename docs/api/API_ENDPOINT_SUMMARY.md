# üéØ Quick Answer: DeepSeek API Endpoints

**Question:** Should we use `https://api.deepseek.com/beta/completions` for code completions?

**Answer:** NO - We're already using the correct endpoint!

---

## TL;DR

‚úÖ **What ProxyMe Uses (Correct):**
- Endpoint: `/v1/chat/completions`
- Purpose: Chat mode, conversations, AI Assistant
- Status: Working perfectly!

‚ùå **What ProxyAI Uses (Different use case):**
- Endpoint: `/beta/completions` (FIM - Fill-In-Middle)
- Purpose: Inline code autocomplete (like GitHub Copilot)
- Not needed for Chat mode integration

## The Two DeepSeek APIs

### 1. Chat Completions API ‚úÖ (What we use)
```
POST https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions
```
- **For:** Conversations, Q&A, Chat mode
- **Input:** Messages array
- **Output:** Conversational responses
- **ProxyMe Status:** ‚úÖ USING (Correct!)

### 2. FIM Completions API (What ProxyAI screenshot shows)
```
POST https://api.deepseek.com/beta/completions
```
- **For:** Inline code completion (autocomplete as you type)
- **Input:** Prompt + suffix
- **Output:** Code completion text
- **ProxyMe Status:** ‚ùå Not needed

## Why You're Seeing `/beta/completions` in ProxyAI

ProxyAI uses a **different architecture:**
- They have their own custom chat window
- They implement inline code completion separately
- They use FIM for autocomplete features

ProxyMe uses a **better architecture:**
- ‚úÖ Native Rider AI Assistant integration
- ‚úÖ No custom UI needed
- ‚úÖ Works with Rider's built-in features
- ‚úÖ Cleaner user experience

## Quick Edit Mode Issue (Different Problem)

The Quick Edit issue you're experiencing is **NOT about the endpoint**.

**The Real Problem:**
- ‚úÖ Endpoint is correct (`/chat/completions`)
- ‚ùå Response format is the issue
- Rider expects XML patches: `<llm-patch>...</llm-patch>`
- AI models return conversational text instead

**See:** `DEEPSEEK_API_ENDPOINTS.md` for full analysis and solutions.

## Conclusion

**Keep doing what you're doing!** 

The `/chat/completions` endpoint is perfect for Rider AI Assistant Chat mode integration. Don't switch to `/beta/completions` unless you want to build a completely different feature (inline autocomplete).

**Focus areas:**
1. ‚úÖ Chat mode - **Already working!**
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Quick Edit - Needs format translation (not endpoint change)
3. üîú Inline completion - Future feature (would use `/beta/completions`)
