# Releasing ProxyMe to GitHub

This document explains how to create a fresh Git repository with a clean history and deploy to GitHub.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Why Fresh History?

The current Git history contains:
- Development logs and internal notes
- Absolute file paths from the development machine
- Old experimental code and iterations
- Private session summaries and debugging notes

A fresh Git history provides:
- Clean, professional commit history
- Only production-ready code
- No sensitive development artifacts
- Better onboarding for contributors

---

## üìã Pre-Release Checklist

Before creating the fresh repository, verify:

- [x] All sensitive information removed
- [x] Old development markdown files deleted
- [x] Python scripts removed
- [x] Documentation updated and cleaned
- [x] .gitignore comprehensive and accurate
- [x] LICENSE file added
- [x] CONTRIBUTING.md created
- [x] README.md professional and complete
- [x] CHANGELOG.md created
- [x] Release ZIP file in `release/` directory
- [x] All package.json files updated with correct URLs
- [x] No hardcoded usernames or paths remain
- [x] Build tested and working

```
git tag -a backup-before-release -m "Backup before fresh history"

# Create a new orphan branch (no history)
git checkout --orphan fresh-main

# Add all files
git add -A

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial release: ProxyMe v2.1.0
