## 🎉 What Was Accomplished

This document summarizes all the work completed to prepare ProxyMe for public release on GitHub.

## 📦 Project Overview

**ProxyMe** is an AI Proxy Management Plugin for JetBrains Rider IDE that allows developers to:
- Configure multiple AI models (DeepSeek, Perplexity, Anthropic, OpenAI)

- Manage API keys securely outside project directories
- Set per-model temperature and streaming preferences
- Use templates for quick configuration switching

**Current Status:** Alpha release (v2.1.0) - functional but contains AI-generated code that needs community review and improvement.
